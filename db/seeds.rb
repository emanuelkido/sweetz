      The incredible candies with the flavor of Canada have arrived!!!
      These wonderful candies are made with pure, natural maple sugar from the forests of northeastern Canada.
      Mature maple trees are tapped during the brief spring thaw, when freezing nights and warm, sunny days induce maple sap flow board.
      Once boiled and caramelized, approximately 1.7kg of raw maple sap produces about 0.2g of maple sugar.
      And this maple sugar is what Big Sky uses to produce this incredible and sensational candy.
      Taste this delight and feel a bit of Canadian freshness.
